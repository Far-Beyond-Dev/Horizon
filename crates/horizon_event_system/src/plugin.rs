//! # Plugin System Interface
//!
//! This module defines the plugin system interfaces and error types for the
//! Horizon Event System. It provides both high-level and low-level plugin
//! development interfaces to support different use cases.
//!
//! ## Plugin Development Approaches
//!
//! ### High-Level: SimplePlugin Trait
//! - Safe, easy-to-use interface for most plugin development
//! - Automatic panic handling and FFI safety
//! - Focus on game logic rather than systems programming
//! - Use with the `create_simple_plugin!` macro
//!
//! ### Low-Level: Plugin Trait
//! - Direct FFI interface for maximum control
//! - Required for plugins with special requirements
//! - Manual panic handling and safety management
//! - Direct dynamic library interface
//!
//! ## Plugin Lifecycle
//!
//! 1. **Creation** - Plugin instance created via `new()`
//! 2. **Pre-initialization** - Handler registration phase
//! 3. **Initialization** - Setup with server context
//! 4. **Operation** - Normal event processing
//! 5. **Shutdown** - Cleanup and resource deallocation
//!
//! ## Error Handling
//!
//! The plugin system provides comprehensive error handling for all lifecycle
//! phases, with automatic panic isolation to prevent plugin failures from
//! crashing the host server.

// ============================================================================
// Plugin Development Interfaces
// ============================================================================

/// Simplified plugin trait that doesn't require unsafe code.
/// 
/// This trait provides a safe, high-level interface for plugin development.
/// It handles all the complex FFI and lifecycle management internally,
/// allowing plugin developers to focus on game logic rather than
/// low-level systems programming.
/// 
/// # Lifecycle
/// 
/// 1. **Creation**: Plugin instance is created via `new()`
/// 2. **Handler Registration**: `register_handlers()` is called to set up event handlers
/// 3. **Initialization**: `on_init()` is called with server context
/// 4. **Operation**: Plugin receives and processes events
/// 5. **Shutdown**: `on_shutdown()` is called for cleanup
/// 
/// # Examples
/// 
/// ```rust
/// struct ChatPlugin {
///     message_count: u64,
/// }
/// 
/// impl ChatPlugin {
///     fn new() -> Self {
///         Self { message_count: 0 }
///     }
/// }
/// 
/// #[async_trait]
/// impl SimplePlugin for ChatPlugin {
///     fn name(&self) -> &str { "chat_system" }
///     fn version(&self) -> &str { "1.0.0" }
///     
///     async fn register_handlers(&mut self, events: Arc<EventSystem>) -> Result<(), PluginError> {
///         events.on_client("chat", "message", |event: RawClientMessageEvent| {
///             // Process chat message
///             Ok(())
///         }).await?;
///         Ok(())
///     }
/// }
/// 
/// create_simple_plugin!(ChatPlugin);
/// ```

    /// is shutting down. Use this for:
    /// - Saving persistent state
    /// - Cleaning up resources
    /// - Canceling background tasks
    /// - Notifying external services

/// Low-level plugin trait for FFI compatibility.
/// 
/// This trait defines the interface that plugin dynamic libraries must implement
/// for compatibility with the plugin loader. Most plugin developers should use
/// the `SimplePlugin` trait instead, which provides a higher-level interface.
/// 
/// # Plugin Lifecycle
/// 
/// 1. **Pre-initialization**: `pre_init()` for handler registration
/// 2. **Initialization**: `init()` for setup with server context  
/// 3. **Operation**: Plugin receives and processes events
/// 4. **Shutdown**: `shutdown()` for cleanup
/// 
/// # FFI Safety
/// 
/// This trait is designed to be safe across FFI boundaries when used with
/// the `create_simple_plugin!` macro, which handles all the necessary
/// panic catching and error conversion.
