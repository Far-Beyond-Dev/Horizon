//! # Server Context Interface
//!
//! This module defines the server context interface that provides plugins with
//! access to core server services. The context serves as the primary bridge
//! between plugin code and the host server infrastructure.
//!
//! ## Core Services
//!
//! The [`ServerContext`] provides access to:
//! - **Event System** - For emitting events and registering additional handlers
//! - **Logging** - Structured logging integrated with server infrastructure
//! - **Player Communication** - Direct messaging and broadcasting capabilities
//! - **Region Information** - Context about the current game region
//!
//! ## Design Principles
//!
//! - **Minimal Interface**: Only essential services are exposed to plugins
//! - **Type Safety**: All operations use strongly typed interfaces
//! - **Async Support**: Network operations are non-blocking and async
//! - **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types for all fallible operations
//!
//! ## Thread Safety
//!
//! All context operations are thread-safe and can be called from multiple
//! threads concurrently. The context uses appropriate synchronization
//! internally to ensure data consistency.

/// Server context interface providing access to core server services.
/// 
/// This trait defines the interface that plugins use to interact with the
/// core server. It provides access to essential services like the event
/// system, logging, and player communication while maintaining a clean
/// separation between plugin code and server internals.
/// 
/// # Design Principles
/// 
/// - **Minimal Interface**: Only essential services are exposed
/// - **Type Safety**: All operations are strongly typed
/// - **Async Support**: All potentially blocking operations are async
/// - **Error Handling**: Proper error types for all fallible operations
/// 
/// # Examples
/// 
/// ```rust
/// use horizon_event_system::{ServerContext, LogLevel, PluginError};
/// use std::sync::Arc;
/// 
/// # async fn example_plugin_init() -> Result<(), PluginError> {
/// # use horizon_event_system::{create_horizon_event_system, RegionId};
/// # let context: Arc<dyn ServerContext> = Arc::new(TestServerContext::new());
/// 
/// // Access event system
/// let events = context.events();
/// 
/// // Log plugin initialization
/// context.log(LogLevel::Info, "Combat plugin initialized");
/// 
/// // Get current region
/// let region_id = context.region_id();
/// 
/// Ok(())
/// # }
/// 
/// # struct TestServerContext { events: std::sync::Arc<horizon_event_system::EventSystem> }
/// # impl TestServerContext {
/// #     fn new() -> Self { Self { events: horizon_event_system::create_horizon_event_system() } }
/// # }
/// # #[horizon_event_system::async_trait]
/// # impl ServerContext for TestServerContext {
/// #     fn events(&self) -> std::sync::Arc<horizon_event_system::EventSystem> { self.events.clone() }

/// Enumeration of log levels for structured logging.
/// 
/// These levels follow standard logging conventions and integrate with
/// the server's logging infrastructure. Higher levels indicate more
/// severe or important messages.
/// 
/// # Level Guidelines
/// 
/// - **Error**: System errors, plugin failures, critical issues
/// - **Warn**: Recoverable errors, deprecated usage, performance issues  
/// - **Info**: General information, plugin lifecycle, major events
/// - **Debug**: Detailed debugging information, development diagnostics
/// - **Trace**: Very detailed execution traces, performance profiling
/// 
/// # Examples
/// 
/// ```rust
/// use horizon_event_system::LogLevel;
/// 
/// # struct TestContext;
/// # impl TestContext {
/// #     fn log(&self, level: LogLevel, msg: &str) {}
/// # }
/// # let context = TestContext;
/// context.log(LogLevel::Info, "Combat plugin initialized successfully");
