# Horizon v0.22.0 - Event System Simplification & GORC Modernization

## üöÄ Major Features

### Simplified Horizon Event System Initialization

This release introduces a new, streamlined API that simplifies how developers initialize and configure the Horizon event system. Recognizing that not all applications require the full complexity of Game Object Replication Channels (GORC), we've provided clear pathways for both comprehensive and lightweight setups.

**New Initialization Methods:**

  * **`create_complete_horizon_system()`**: A new, comprehensive function designed for applications that require the full power of Horizon's event system, including integrated GORC capabilities for robust object replication.
  * **`create_simple_horizon_system()`**: A lightweight option for initializing the event system without the overhead of replication channels. This is ideal for simpler use cases where only basic event handling is needed, offering a quicker setup and reduced footprint.

### Modular & Optimized GORC Architecture

The Game Object Replication Channels (GORC) system within `horizon_event_system` has undergone a significant internal refactoring. This modernization effort aims to improve maintainability, clarity, and future scalability of the replication framework.

**Key Internal Changes:**

  * **Modular GORC Channels**: The previously monolithic `gorc/channels.rs` module has been split into several focused submodules: `channel.rs`, `layer.rs`, `manager.rs`, `mod.rs`, `registry.rs`, and `types.rs`. This enhances organization and makes specific components easier to understand and maintain.
  * **Restructured GORC Subsystems**: Old modules like `gorc/network.rs`, `gorc/multicast.rs`, and `gorc/spatial.rs` have been removed. Their functionalities have been integrated into new, dedicated submodules under their respective directories, providing a clearer separation of concerns for network communication, multicasting, and spatial partitioning within GORC.

## üèóÔ∏è API Additions

### New System Creation Functions

  - `create_complete_horizon_system()`: For setting up a full Horizon system with GORC integration.
  - `create_simple_horizon_system()`: For a lightweight Horizon event system without replication.

## üîÑ Breaking Changes

### Plugin Recompilation Required

**Important**: Plugins built against previous versions of `horizon_event_system` will need to be recompiled due to the crate version bump to **0.4.0**. While the public API aims for backward compatibility where possible for existing event patterns, the extensive internal refactoring (especially within GORC and system initialization) means the underlying Application Binary Interface (ABI) has changed.

**For Plugin Developers:**

  * Recompile all your plugins with the updated `horizon_event_system = "0.4.0"` dependency in your `Cargo.toml`.
  * No code changes are typically required for existing event handler patterns, but if your plugin interacted directly with previous GORC internal structures or system initialization methods, you may need to review and adapt your code to the new API.

**For Server Operators:**

  * Ensure all plugins are updated and recompiled against `horizon_event_system 0.4.0` before deploying Horizon v0.22.0.

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Experience

### Project Structure Enhancements

  * Internal codebases, including `lib.rs` and `macros.rs`, have been updated to reflect and utilize the new modular structure, leading to improved code consistency and a more intuitive development environment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Changed APIs (Non-Exhaustive List)

Based on the provided patch, here are the key API changes:

**New API Additions:**

  * **`create_complete_horizon_system()`**: A new function for comprehensive Horizon event system setup, including GORC integration.
  * **`create_simple_horizon_system()`**: A new function for a lightweight Horizon event system setup without replication channels.

**Modified/Replaced API Patterns:**

  * **GORC Object Layer Initialization**: The pattern for initializing or accessing replication layers for GORC-enabled objects has changed. Previously, static `init_layers()` methods (e.g., `Player::init_layers()`, `Asteroid::init_layers()`) were used. Now, layers are accessed via instance methods (e.g., `player.get_layers()`, `asteroid.get_layers()`) after object instantiation. This indicates a shift from static layer initialization to instance-based layer retrieval or construction.
